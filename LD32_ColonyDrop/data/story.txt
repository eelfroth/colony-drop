The sun holds watch over the deep valleys of DENYSTHIA.
Visible beyond eternity, the planet of colossal green,
It is the product of weathering augite and hornblende.
          
The lizard poeple inhabit this ancient planet.
Every lizard carries in their body a green crystal,
But these crystals differ in their active agents.
          
Millions of years ago, a conspiracy divided the reptiles.
Some of them realized that the green crystal inside was
Not always friendly and carried powers of great destruction.
          
From this division emerged a warfaring tribe, some of which
Dissapeared mysterieously and were not seen from that day.
But the conspiracy was lurking deep inside...
          
For one millenium, a peacful secluded system orbited the planet.
It was known as SPACE COLONY, inhabited by mammalian beings,
Drawing harmony from their blue chalcedon, the ship's core.
          
Through telepathic and visionary abilities, the seperatist
Lizards conquered the colony. The goal of this self-proclaimed
Elite was to destroy the ship and let it fall onto the planet.
          
Their former home planet would be destroyed by the impact.
And so they did it... The conquered SPACE COLONY is racing
with unstoppable speed towards DENYSTHIA!
          
VALLETH, a lizard with pale green scales, was chosen to defend
the planet DENYSTHIA with all his reptilian powers. The young
warrior took off in his space craft to vaporize the SPACE COLONY.
